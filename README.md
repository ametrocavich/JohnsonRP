NEWS: (10-27-2012) CUSTOM TEAM/SHIPMENT/ENTITY SYNTAX CHANGED. STILL COMPATIBLE WITH OLDER SYNTAX. YOUR CUSTOM FILES CHANGED.

Please try to use the git protocol instead of SVN to get access to DarkRP. GitHub has a very nice program for it:
http://windows.github.com/


If you really can't/don't want to use git, you can still use SVN.
